# G-Navigation

It is a navigation app that uses Google Maps SDK. There are 3 different locations that the user need to reach to complete the challenge. The finish screen will be pushed when the 3 target locations are completed in order.

* The user's location is updated with every movement. 
* The route is updated according to the user's updated location
* The current target location is completed when there is a distance of 30 meters from the target location.
* After completing a destination, an alert message pop-ups and the app loads the new target.
